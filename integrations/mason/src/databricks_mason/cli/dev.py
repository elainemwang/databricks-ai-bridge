"""`mason dev` — run a scaffolded agent locally, wrapping `databricks apps run-local`.

Runs the app from its ``app.yaml`` exactly as the Databricks Apps runtime would locally: reads the
manifest's command + env, and (with ``--prepare-environment``) builds the venv via uv. This is the
local counterpart to ``mason deploy`` — same source dir, same manifest — so what runs here matches
what ships. Delegating to ``apps run-local`` means mason inherits the Apps team's local-run behavior
rather than re-implementing it.

    Starts the agent on a local server — by default http://localhost:8000 — and prints where to
    reach it: the chat UI if the project has one, otherwise a sample request against the agent's
    API.

    Auth uses your Databricks profile (`-p` / `mason login`), and the agent reaches Databricks model
    serving through the AI Gateway on that profile — so there are no model keys to set up.

    Under the hood this wraps `databricks apps run-local`: it reads the command + env from
    `app.yaml` and runs the app the way the Apps runtime would, so local behavior matches a
    deployment. The environment is built on the first run and reused after; pass
    `--prepare-environment` to force a rebuild (e.g. after changing dependencies).

    Tracing is on by default: dev sends the agent's traces to the default mason experiment based on
    the project name (the same one `mason deploy` uses), created and pinned into agent.toml on first
    run — configure or turn it off with `mason tracing configure` / `disable`. Stores bound with
    `mason memory/sessions bind` are resolved here and injected into the dev-only manifest as env, so
    the runtime picks them up the same way a deployment does. Locally you already have access, so no
    service-principal grant is needed; that grant happens at `mason deploy` time.
