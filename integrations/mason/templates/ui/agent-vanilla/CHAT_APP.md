# Mason Vanilla Chat App Overlay

`mason init --framework vanilla` copies this framework-specific overlay after the base
`agent-vanilla` template (it is included by default; `--disable-chat-app` opts out). It is
intentionally not a post-generation mutation command.

## Installed files

- `ui/` contains the zero-build chat client.
- `runtime/ui.py` serves the assets and exposes demo APIs for memory and sessions.
- `runtime/main.py` installs the chat routes on the base FastAPI runtime.
- `tests/test_demo_ui.py` verifies the browser-facing routes.

## Behavior

The capability indicators are automatic. Streaming and background reflect the runtime contract;
Session reflects transcript history; Memory requires `AGENT_MEMORY_STORE`. The transport selector is
the only manual capability choice. This template runs a hand-rolled loop with no human-in-the-loop
tool gating, so `GET /api/demo/config` returns `hitl: false` and the UI hides its approval controls.

The UI reads local history from the in-process session store (a message list) and managed history
from Session Store items. The Databricks Apps `__Host-databricks-app-router` cookie is both the
sticky routing key and the application session id; request bodies do not carry `session_id`. Local
development uses the runtime's `mason-local-session` fallback cookie. TODO: switch to `X-Routing-Key`
when Apps supports it.

The Sessions card calls `POST /api/session/new` to replace that routing cookie with a fresh UUID and
start an empty conversation. With a managed Session Store, `GET /api/demo/sessions` lists the most
recent sessions for the configured actor and each Open action calls
`POST /api/demo/sessions/{session_id}/open`. Opening a listed session verifies that it belongs to the
same actor, replaces the routing cookie, and reloads its transcript. In local in-memory mode only the
current browser session can be listed because there is no shared session index.

Transcript responses include only user, assistant, tool, and system message items.
